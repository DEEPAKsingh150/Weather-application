⭐ Project Description (Short & Powerful Version)

I built a Weather Forecasting Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user can search for any city, and the app fetches real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using a weather API.
I also integrated an AI Chat Assistant into the app so that users can ask questions like ‘What should I wear today?’ or ‘Will it rain tomorrow?’ and the AI responds based on the weather data.
